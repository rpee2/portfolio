									<h2><big>Recycled Blocks for Sustainable Reconstruction</big></h2>
									<span>Role: Research, Design, Lab</span>
									<p>
										For my design capstone, I worked with four other students on a design project.
										My team was attached to a team of researchers from Northwestern University and World Wildlife Fund working on sustainable reconstruction in the aftermath of the 2015 Nepal earthquakes.
										We designed a project that could supplement their research efforts.
										The project was a look into the recycling of debris to create masonry blocks.
									</p>
									<h4>Problem with Disaster Debris Management</h4>
									<p>
										The presence of a large amount of debris in a natural disaster hinders the rebuilding of communities, especially for many less-developed countries who have limited means to clear the debris.
										It took three years to clear 80% of the ten million cubic foot of debris created in the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
										When the rebuilding occurs, many natural resources are used, placing a large constraint on these resources and raising the issue of sustainability.
									</p>
									<h4>Defining the Scope of the Project</h4>
									<p>
										We researched on how communities deal with disaster debris and talked to subject matter experts.
										One of the things that is unclear is how exactly debris is recycled.
										We decided to look into how debris can be recycled to rebuild houses.
										We decided to try making masonry blocks out of recycled materials.
										Our approach would include formulating a suggested list of recycled materials and the appropriate compositions that could be used for masonry blocks.

										</div>
									</p>
										<h4>Project Planning</h4>
										<p>
											I researched about concrete and the types of material that can be used to make concrete.
											We chose to use only recycled materials consisting of wood, polypropylene and old concrete, because they are common debris materials.
											I talked with a few PhD students working with concrete and designed a set of experiments.
											The experiment varied the composition of the materials to make recycled concrete blocks.
											These blocks would be compared against the minimal strength of concrete blocks as set by international standards.

											</div>
										</p>
										<h4>Experimental Setup: Making and Testing Concrete Blocks</h4>
										<p>
											We sourced for recycled concrete from a local contractor, wood particles from a woodworking shop and polyethylene fibers from a raw material supplier.
											We got trained in a concrete lab in school and made our recycled blocks.
											After curing, we tested the strength of the blocks and compared them against ASTM standards.
											The best recipe gave us 20% of the target strength of the minimum strength.

											</div>
										</p>
										<h4>Future Work</h4>
										<p>
											Since the project is new, there are many other areas to look at.
											The most important would be to continue optimizing the experiments to achieve a block mix that meets the standards.
											Another area to look at is to test the thermal resistance and sound-proofing properties of the blocks, since the use of wood in these blocks can improve these properties.
