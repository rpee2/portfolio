									<span>Role: Research, Design, Lab</span>

									<h4>Overview</h4>
									<p>
										For my design capstone project, my team collaborated with a team of researchers from Northwestern University and World Wildlife Fund who are working on the issue of sustainable reconstruction for the 2015 Nepal earthquakes.
										My team used the design process to define a meaningful problem and create a useful solution.
										We arrived at the concept of managing the issues of materials sourcing and debris management by repurposing debris to make concrete blocks.
										<br>
										We progressed into making the reycled concrete blocks and conducting factorial experiments as a preliminary look into the effects of using different debris compositions for the blocks.
									 	This gave us some understanding of the feasibility of using recycled concrete blocks as a building material.

										</div>
									</p>

									<h4>Defining the Project Scope</h4>
									<p>
										We conducted online research and expert interviews to immerse ourselves in our project's domain.
										One of the things we learnt is that the presence of a large amount of debris in a natural disaster hinders the rebuilding of communities, especially many less-developed countries who have limited means to clear the debris.
										One statistic revealed that it took three years to clear 80% of the ten million cubic foot of debris created in the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
										<br>
										Furthermore, when the rebuilding occurs, many natural resources are used, placing a large constraint on these resources and raising the issue of sustainability.
										This is a problem and opportunity because we realized many rural communities are unprepared when a disaster strikes and there are a unique set of challenges faced by each community.
									</p>


									<h4>Brainstorming and Analysis</h4>
									<p>
										With the problem in mind, we started to generate ideas - we brainstormed as a team and we also held an open brainstorming session.
										One of the early concepts was a shipping container called 'the box' that could supply equipment to remote areas for onsite recycling.
										We chose to explore the box further as it had potential.
										One of our outputs was in the form of a graphic that showcased the reconstruction journey map and how the box would fit in this process.
										<br>
										However, after reviewing in group meetings and in class, we found that we could not progress beyond a nonspecific application of the box.
										A cost-benefit analysis also helped us realize that the additional benefit of using a small-scale shipping container is hard to justify over a larger-scale recycling facility.
									</p>

										</div>
									<p>
										<br>
										So, we decided to pivot to something more manageable.
										We were able to use the same graphic we created earlier to narrow our project's focus down into a much smaller part of the reconstruction journey map.
										We decided to make concrete blocks out of recycled debris with cement as the bonding agent.
										Cement is a commodity which produces concrete, a ubiquitous building material known for its strength.
										This approach would look at the same issues of materials sourcing and debris management but at a smaller scale.
										By creating a factorial experiment and changing the debris composition, we would be able to test the properties of the blocks and determine their feasibility as building material.
										Our approach would include formulating a suggested list of recycled materials and the optimal compositions that could be used for making the blocks.
									</p>

									<h4>Project Planning</h4>
									<p>
										Once the project scope was determined, the project progressed relatively quickly.
										As I was interested in learning about the material aspect of the project, I took the lead in researching about concrete and the types of material to make concrete.
										We chose to use limit our factorial experiment and choose common debris materials consisting of wood, polyethylene and concrete.
										I contacted a few PhD students working with concrete who helped to design the factorial experiment.
										We then compared the blocks against the required strength of concrete blocks as set by the ASTM international standard.

										</div>
									</p>

									<h4>Making and Testing Concrete Blocks</h4>
									<p>
										We sourced for recycled concrete from a local contractor, wood particles from a woodworking shop and polyethylene fibers from a raw material supplier.
										We were trained in a concrete lab in school and made our recycled blocks there.
										After curing, we tested the strength of the blocks and performed statistical analysis to compare them against the ASTM standard.
										The best recipe gave us 20% of the target strength.

										</div>
									</p>

									<h4>Thoughts and Future Work</h4>
									<p>
										Our project was relatively successful.
										Despite the final product not being up to par, we identified a useful problem and created a meaningful project with the design process.
										I have gained an appreciation for the design process and I would say it is one of my biggest takeaways of the project.
										<br>
										As for the blocks, it is still a priority to continue optimizing the experiments to achieve a block mix that meets the strength standards.
										Additionally, there are other areas to examine besides strength, such as the thermal resistance and sound-proofing properties of the blocks.
										The use of wood in these blocks can theoretically improve those properties which in turn value-add and future-proof the blocks.
										In fact, our project mentor who is a Northwestern professor is continuing our project in his research group.
